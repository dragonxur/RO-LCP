## Ralph CLI Validation

Ralph Orchestrator was executed using a project-local configuration
with the opencode backend and a local Ollama provider.

The agent successfully entered the event loop, processed the prompt,
used its scratchpad, and terminated upon detecting the completion promise.

Execution logs are available under artifacts/ralph.
